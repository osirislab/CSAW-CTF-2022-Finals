# CryPtown

CryPtown is a Crypto and Pwn heap challenge.

The idea of crypto part comes from Prof. Giovanni: randomness could make decryption harder. But, I have a way to exploit it. Actually, there is a vulnerability in encryption part and I can even exploit the scheme without the vulnerability. It's pretty hard to find it. To make it fun and educational, I preffer to leave it as a secret! 

For the pwn part, there is a heap overflow. However, this vul could hardly be triggered by a normal `randomness`. People are supposed to trigger it after finishing `challenge` (the crypto part).
