Well, well, well!! You finally found part2 of the flag! 
Here you go: "of these is ?"

There seems to be an issue though. The last word is missing! 
The missing word in lowercase and encoded in base64 is the flag!

Also, for example, if the word was "macabre", the format of the flag is as follows(without the quotes obviously):
"flag{bWFjYWJyZQ==}"
